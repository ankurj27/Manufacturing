# Manufacturing Dataset
a Production Summary Dashboard includes key Manufacturing Metrics:

1. Production Metrics
   -- YTD Production
   -- Cumulative Production

2. Quality Metrics
   -- YTD Defects
   -- Defects by Category
   -- Cumulative Rework Hours
   -- Cumulative Quality Checks Failed

3. Cost Metrics
   -- Cumulative Production Cost (Material Cost + Labor Cost + Energy Cost)

4. Operational Metrics
   -- Top Machines by Category
   -- YTD Downtime Hours
   -- Weekly Trend over Production & Defects
   -- YTD Maintenance Hours vs Downtime Hours
   -- Shift Wise Operator Count

5. Environmental Impact
   -- Defects vs Avg Temperature & Humidity
   -- Energy Consumption per Unit Produced
